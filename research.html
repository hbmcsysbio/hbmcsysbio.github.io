<h2>Research Interests</h2>
		  <h3 id="tc">TRANSCRIPTIONAL CONTROL</h3>
		  <p>When plants respond to internal or external signals, large sets of genes are switched on and off with precise spatiotemporal programming. The coordinated switching is realized by transcription factors --- a category of proteins that recognize specific DNA codes and regulate the gene expressions nearby.&nbsp; In eukaryotes, DNA is packaged in nucleosomes. When bound, the nucleosomes prevent transcription by excluding the binding of transcription machinery to DNA. We are interested in how transcription factors overcome such barrier, to regulate local chromatin accessibility and activate expression of corresponding genes. As the sites recognized by transcription factors reside in the regulatory noncoding genome, which remains largely underexplored  for its functions. Our team aims to both unravel the transcriptional control mechanisms and the functions of the noncoding genome.</p>

		<h3 id="cfd">CELL FATE DECISION</h3>
		<p>All plant cells share the identical genome but their fates are distinctly different. The determinant of cell fate is the differential gene expression. Previous researches on iPS have demonstrated that a few transcription factors are adequate  to reprogram cell fate. We are thus interested in finding out<br>
		  1）What are the most important transcription factors associated with cells of different fates<br>
		  2）How such transcription factors regulate gene expression and chromatin accessibility<br>
		  3）How to reprogram cell fate, to facilitate plant regeneration and contribute to gene editing techniques<br>

<h3 id="em">SEQUENCING-BASED TECHNOLOGIES</h3>
<p>In the past decade, the emergence and development of sequencing-based technologies have generated data in an unprecedented scale, allowing scientists to study transcriptional control from a whole-genome perspective and at a systems level. Combining high-throughput  experiments and data analysis, we also strive to develop novel sequencing-based technologies, to assist the epigenetic studies on transcriptional control.<br>
